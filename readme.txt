Version 1

About:
This is 99% boilerplate migrated over from my nightmode enforcer and rayslive extensions.  I just wanted to see if I could make a horrible little browser gremlin that changes all your text to wingdings.

Installation:  
To install this extension in chrome or brave, go to chrome://extensions (or brave://extensions); you will need to enable developer mode, which can be done by clicking on the tickbox on the upper right of the browser window.  Once you download the extension folder, select the "Load Unpacked" button on the top lefthand corner of the page and navigate to the extension folder in your file browser.  Select the folder itself; no need to navigate to a subfolder or any of the files.  From there, you should be able to simply click the extension, and it will change all <body> and <div> tags to a different background color.

Advanced:
For best results, put this on a coworker's computer and enable it while they're not looking.

Known issues:
Right now since it's all boilerplate, you have to actually click the icon in order to activate the wingdings apocalypse.  Ideally once the extension is installed, it runs everywhere without having to be clicked, and without an icon showing up on the unwitting victim's browser.

Disclaimer: Please do not get me in trouble or get fired for abusing this extension, it's just for good fun.  Use at your own risk.
